This work is inspired by Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

the car image dataset is from https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html

I have tried different model but the result just seem barely acceptable. It still need a lot work to improve the gan image.
